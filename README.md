## Purpose
This was created as part of a lesson of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, the main goal being familiarization with the Devise gem for authentication

## Thoughts
While the main goal was to introduce authentication, it also served as a practical lesson on the usage of rails generators to create scaffolding, models and migrations.

Due to being the first project with authentication, I could also experience the idea of conditionals inside the views, changing the page based on the privileges of the current user.
